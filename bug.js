This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses a build process.  The problem is that Tailwind's JIT mode (Just-In-Time) relies on generating the CSS during the build process. If the build process is not configured correctly, or if there are errors in your Tailwind configuration, the generated CSS might be incomplete or missing classes, leading to styling issues.  Specifically, this can manifest if your build process does not correctly detect or process changes to your template files that use Tailwind classes. For example, a new component or page might not reflect changes made to its styling because the build process did not regenerate the CSS.

Example (Next.js):

```javascript
// pages/index.js
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4">This should be red</div>
```

If the build process fails to include `bg-red-500` and `p-4` in the generated CSS, the div will not be styled accordingly.
